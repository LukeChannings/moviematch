## Code

The entire codebase is written in TypeScript, and common types are defined in
[types/moviematch.ts](types/moviematch.ts).

### Dependencies

To get started, you'll need to have these dependencies installed:

- [Deno](https://deno.land)
- [Node.js + NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Project layout

MovieMatch tries to follow
[Golang's unofficial project layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout).

```

│   └── workflows # GitHub Actions config
├── cmd
│   └── moviematch # The entrypoint into the application
├── configs
│   └── localization
├── docs
├── internal

## CI

MovieMatch uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

There is a workflow that runs the test suite (`scripts/test.sh`) for every
commit.

### Release process

1. Ensure that the `VERSION` file reflects the version that is to be released
2. Finalise the [`RELEASE_NOTES`](./RELEASE_NOTES.markdown) for the release
3. Trigger a new
   [release](https://github.com/LukeChannings/moviematch/actions/workflows/release.yaml)
   with **Run workflow**, entering the version to be released.

The workflow will automatically create a GitHub release and publish a Docker
image.

## About the build process

Deno provides a [`compile`](https://deno.land/manual@v1.8.2/tools/compiler)
sub-command that creates a standalone binary for a given platform. This is the
way MovieMatch is distributed.

The end-to-end process is:

1. The front-end is compiled using Snowpack (output is in `web/app/build/dist`)
2. The `pkger` helper command bundles the web app, along with `VERSION` and
   `configs/localization` into `pkg.ts`
3. The `pkged` import is remapped from
   [`pkger.ts`](https://github.com/LukeChannings/moviematch/blob/main/internal/app/moviematch/util/pkger.ts)
   to
   [`pkger_release.ts`](https://github.com/LukeChannings/moviematch/blob/main/internal/app/moviematch/util/pkger_release.ts)
   for production, and all files imported with `readFile`, `readTextFile`, etc.
   are imported from the `pkg.ts` import. (**Note, this is intended to be
   temporary until
   [Import Assertions](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/7623) are
   suitable for adding binary or plain text files into the dependency graph**)
4. `deno compile` creates a JavaScript bundle starting with the
   [`cmd/moviematch/main.ts`](https://github.com/LukeChannings/moviematch/blob/main/cmd/moviematch/main.ts)
   entrypoint and outputs a `moviematch` binary.
