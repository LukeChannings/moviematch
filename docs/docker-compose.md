# Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  moviematch:
   image: lukechannings/moviematch:latest
   container_name: moviematch
   environment:
    PLEX_URL: "<Plex URL>"
    PLEX_TOKEN: "<Plex Token>"
   ports:
      - 8000:8000
```

If your Plex server is hosted at `https://plex.example.com`, and your token was
`abc123` for example, your environment would look like this:

```yaml
environment:
  PLEX_URL: "https://plex.example.com"
  PLEX_TOKEN: "abc123"
```

If you want to use an
[env file](https://github.com/LukeChannings/moviematch/blob/main/.env-template)
instead of passing variables via environment, you can use that with
docker-compose using the
[`env_file`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#env_file)
option.
