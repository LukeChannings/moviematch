/**
 * A generic interface that the Plex provider implements.
 *
 * The point of this is to:
 * - Keep the Plex API integration (/internal/app/plex) portable, so it can possibly be published separately and used by others
 * - Allow MovieMatch to have its own clean data structures, excluding some of the Plex weirdness (since it's converted from XML, it is not idiomatic)
 * - Allow the possibility of providers to MovieMatch that are not Plex (e.g. Emby). I don't plan on implementing it, but it allows others to integrate more easliy.
 * - Allow connecting to multiple providers of the same type, e.g. more than one Plex server
